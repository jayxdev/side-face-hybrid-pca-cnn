# PCA-CNN Hybrid Model for Side Face Recognition

This project explores a novel approach to **side face recognition** using a hybrid of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification. By integrating PCA as a preprocessing step, we achieve high accuracy while significantly reducing the model size compared to traditional CNN-based methods.

---

## Motivation

Side face recognition is a challenging task in computer vision due to variations in facial profiles and occlusions. This research investigates the effectiveness of PCA for reducing the dimensionality of high-resolution side face images, followed by a CNN model for accurate classification. 

The aim is to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining high performance, making this approach suitable for resource-constrained environments.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid PCA-CNN Approach:** 
  - PCA reduces image dimensions while retaining essential features.
  - CNN classifies reconstructed images from PCA-transformed data.
  
- **Improved Training Efficiency:**
  - Reduced model size by **90%** compared to a standard CNN model.
  
- **High Accuracy:**
  - Achieved **94.6% test accuracy** with the hybrid model.

- **Baseline Comparison:**
  - Performance tested without PCA preprocessing for insights on model adaptability.

## Dataset

The dataset includes **side face images** from **21 individuals**, with **50 augmented samples per person**. Images are resized to **480x480 pixels** for consistency.

---

## Workflow

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Input side face images are resized and normalized.
   - PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction, retaining the top 10 components for the analysis.
   - Reconstructed images from PCA are used as inputs for the CNN.

2. **CNN Architecture:**
   - Custom CNN model designed for classification.
   - Trained using reconstructed images with categorical cross-entropy loss.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Validation and test sets are used to measure accuracy, model size, and training time.
   - Baseline model trained directly on original images (without PCA).
